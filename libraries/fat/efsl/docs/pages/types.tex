Standard C data types have the annoying tendency to have different sizes on difference compilers
and platforms. Therefore we have created 9 new types that are used everywhere throughout the library.
When you implement your platform you should check if any of the existing one matches your hardware,
or create a new one.\\
\\
Here's an overview:\\\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|l|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Size} & \textbf{Signedness}\\
	\hline
	\hline
	\texttt{eint8} & 1 byte & default to platform \\
	\texttt{esint8} & 1 byte & signed \\
	\texttt{euint8} & 1 byte & unsigned \\
	\hline
	\texttt{eint16} & 2 bytes & default to platform \\
	\texttt{esint16} & 2 bytes & signed \\
	\texttt{euint16} & 2 bytes & unsigned \\
	\hline
	\texttt{eint32} & 4 bytes & default to platform \\
	\texttt{esint32} & 4 bytes & signed \\
	\texttt{euint32} & 4 bytes & unsigned \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
