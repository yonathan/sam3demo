This library is subject to the Lesser General Public License version 2.1.
We have chosen this license in stead of the BSD license because we feel strongly
that more effort was needed in the field of quality software in the embedded field.

Please note that if you make changes to the library itself, those modifications must be
made public, but that writing support for new hardware and linking it into the library,
does not fall under this category. However, we would off course appreciate it tremendously
if you would send us in code to support new hardware.
